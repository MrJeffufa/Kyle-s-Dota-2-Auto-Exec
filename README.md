This file contains a bind that allows you to bind what ever to whatever.If you want to add binds, just edit this file

Move the "binds" file into the dota 2 cfg file. You do this by going to "This PC" and opening the drive the game is saved on. Once there you open the folder titled as "Program Files (x86)

Once there you follow this path of folders

\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2\game\dota\cfg

Place the file into the cfg folder and title it as autoexec.cfg

Then you make the file type as "All Files"

Then, right click Dota 2 in steam and click "Launch Options"

In there you will type exactly this without the quotations "+exec autoexec"
